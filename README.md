# **Secure Implementation of the MQTT Protocol**

---

### **Overview**

This project implements a fully secure MQTT-based communication system for IoT devices. It provides a reliable and encrypted channel for message exchange between publishers and subscribers through an MQTT broker. The system leverages a reverse proxy (NGINX) for enhanced security and scalability, ensuring robust protection for IoT data. The MQTT broker also utilizes a logging feature to log any abnormalities, allowing for quicker detection of any threats.
